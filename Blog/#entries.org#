# In this entry I will discuss some of the classic and fundamental theorems 
# when studying complex analysis and try to understand the following

# #+begin_thm
# *Cauchy integral theorem.* Let $f:U\to \mathbb{C}$ holomorphic in a domain $U\subset \mathbb{C}$.
# Suppose $\gamma: [a,b]\to U$ is a topological trivial, piecewise  continuously differentiable, closed
# curve. Then
# \begin{equation}
# \int_{\gamma}f(z) dz = 0.
# \end{equation}
# #+end_thm

# One of the first consequences of the Cauchy integral theorem is that if a function $f$
# is holomorphic in a domain $U$, then for any $p\in U$ and every closed disc $\overline{D}$ centered
# at $p$ and  contained in $U$, the function $f$ can be written as a convergent power series, and the
# convergence is absolute and uniform.

# #+begin_thm
# *Cauchy integral formula.* Let $f:U\to \mathbb{C}$ holomorphic in a domain $U\subset \mathbb{C}$.
# Suppose $\gamma: [a,b]\to U$ is a topological trivial, piecewise  continuously differentiable, closed curve. 
# Then
# \begin{equation}
# f(z) = \frac{k!}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}\frac{f(\xi)}{(\xi - z)^{k+1}} d\xi.
# \end{equation}
# #+end_thm

# #+begin_prop
# *Holomorphic extension*. Let $f:D\setminus\{p\}\to \mathbb{C}$ holomorphic on a punctered disk.
# If $f$ is bounded, then $f$ can be extended to a holomorphic function $F: D\to \mathbb{C}$.

One of the most useful tools I have learnt when dealing with convex geometry is that of the support function.
It has been used to prove the uniformly ellipticity of a given geometric fully nonlinear elliptic equation, or
to get estimates on the principal curvatures of a strictly convex hypersurface.

Consider the Euclidean space $R^n$ with its inner product $\cdot$. 
Then, any hyperplane can be defined by a point in this plane $x_0$ and a unit normal vector $\nu \in R^n$ 
as all $x\in R^n$ satisfying the equation
\begin{equation}
 \nu \cdot (x_0 - x) = 0.
\end{equation}

One can also think of $\nu = \nu(x)$ as the constant unit vector field along the hyperplane,
and then the last equation says that the function $\varphi(x) = \nu(x)\cdot x$ has a constant
value, namely, *the distance from the origin to the hyperplane*.

If $\Sigma \subset R^{n+1}$ is a strictly convex hypersurface in the Euclidean space,
then the Gauss map $n:\Sigma\to S^n$ is a diffeomorphism with the unit sphere $S^n$.
At every $x\in\Sigma$, corresponds one unit vector $n(x)$ which is perpendicular to the
tangent hyperplane to $\Sigma$ at $x$. Then one can define the *support function* of $\Sigma$,
$u:S^n \to R$ as
\begin{equation}
u(\xi) = \xi \cdot n^{-1}(\xi), \quad \xi \in S^n \subset R^{n+1}.
\end{equation}

Note that the tangent hyperplane to $\Sigma$ at  $n^{-1}(\xi)$ has a unit normal vector $\xi$ then
the support function is clearly the distance from the origin of $R^{n+1}$ to this hyperplane.

This is one of the relations that I always forget, so I will keep it
here for the future. When I hear someone speaking about Brownian
motion immediately comes to my head a voice saying /... you know, the
probabilistic representation of harmonic functions.../ but never manage
to remember how this link is done. 

Here are the ingredients I need to build the bridge:
- A domain in $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$.
- A Brownian motion starting at $x\in \Omega$, i.e. $X^*_t = x + X_t$.
- A pay off function $\varphi:\partial\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$, so the
  first time the Brownian motion hits the boundary at
  $z\in\partial\Omega$ we get a payoff $\varphi(z)$.

If $T$ is the first hitting time of $X^*_T$, define
\begin{equation}
u(x) = \mathbb{E}[\varphi(X^*_T)].
\end{equation}

Now consider the ball $B_r(x)$ contained in $\Omega$. The key
observation is that from the properties of Brownian motion $X^*_t$ its
possible to conclude that the process will hit any point in the
boundary with the same probability.

This observation implies that $u$ satisfies the mean value property, 
and consequently is a solution of the following Dirichlet problem:

\begin{equation}
\left\{ \begin{array}{cccc}
\Delta u &=& 0& \mbox{in}\quad \Omega\\
 u &=& \varphi & \mbox{on}\quad \partial\Omega\\
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

This method was developed by the Russian mathematician A. D. Alexandrov (Aleksandrov),
to prove that any connected, closed surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) 
is actually the round sphere.

It is also known that J. Serring used this method

If we want to obtain a closed geodesic in a compact Riemannian manifold
all we have to do is get one loop and wait. Yes just wait long enough and, surprisingly,
our loop will transform into a geodesic one. Moreover,
take a smooth close loop in a compact Riemannian manifold,
of course this belongs to a homotopy class. Suppose now
that we are able to measure the energy of our loop with some sort of
thermometer, and that changes of this energy may produce some elongation or contraction 
of the loop, measured by its length. Then we wait for a reasonable long
period of time for our
loop to cool down and.. we end up with a geodesic of the same homotopy class!

Well, unfortunately not quite. The problem of passing
from $t_n$ to $t$ (see below) in the convergence is something that
needs to be treated carefully.

The curve $\gamma : (a,b) \subset \mathbb{R} \to M$ is geodesic if and
only if in local coordinates it satisfies
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\gamma}^k(t) + \dot{\gamma}^i(t)\dot{\gamma}^j)(t)\Gamma_{ij}^{k}(\gamma(t)) = 0.
\end{equation}

Before we continue just a word of /warning/: note that for any compact
Riemannian manifold, and two points in it, there are always more than
one geodesic joining them, a quick example of this is the sphere with
the North and South pole. The uniqueness of the shortest geodesic is
guaranteed when the two points are sufficiently close. The method we
will describe, produces a geodesic but It may not necessarily be the
shortest one.

*Theorem* /Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian manifold. Then every
homotopy class of closed curves in $M$ contains a geodesic./

To apply the heat flow approach, we consider the following 
family of curves:
\begin{equation}
u : S^1 \times [0,\infty) \to M,
\end{equation}
where $S^1$ is the unite circle, and the parabolic equation
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
u_{t} &= u^k_{ss} + u^i_{s}u^j_{s}\Gamma_{ij}^k & \,\,s\in S^1, t\geq 0,\\
u(s,0)& = \gamma(s) & \,\, s\in S^1.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

** The Heat Flow Method

Now we write  the method to obtain the geodesic as outlined by 
J. Jost in his  /Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis/.

1) *Short time existence*. There exist $T_0>0$ such that the initial
   value problem above has a solution $u^k_{t} = u^k_{ss} +
   u^i_{s}u^j_{s}\Gamma_{ij}^k$ in $S^1\times [0,T_0)$ and
   $u(s,0)=\gamma(s)$. Then the maximal (time) interval of existence
   of a solution is nonempty and open.
2) *A priori estimates of spacial derivatives*. Let $u(s,t)$ be a
   solution. Get an a priori estimate of the spacial derivative $|u_s|
   \leq C$, where $C$ independently of $t$. Then we can think of the
   equation $u_t - u_{ss} =f$, where $f$ is a bounded function. Then
   regularity theory for linear parabolic equations is used to
   control higher order derivatives which are time independent.
3) *Convergence as $t$ goes to $\infty$*. This a priori estimate
   implies the following: If a solution exists in $[0,T_{0})$, and for
   $t\to T_{0}$ the solution $u(s,t)$ will converge to a smooth curve
   $u(s,T_{0})$. Then this curve can be taken as the new initial value
   and continue the solution for times bigger than $T_{0}$. Then the
   maximal interval of existence of a solution is also a closed
   set. This at the end implies that a solution exists for all times
   $t>0$.
4) *The Energy functional is decreasing*. Note that the energy
   $E(u(s,t))$ is decreasing in $t$ and since $0 \leq E(u(s,t))$ for
   all $t$, it is possible to find a sequence $\{t_n\}$ such that
   $u(s,t) \to \tilde{\gamma}(s)$, $t\to \infty$, and $\tilde{\gamma}$
   is such that $\tilde{\gamma}^k_{ss} +
   \tilde{\gamma}^i_{s}\tilde{\gamma}^j_{s}\Gamma_{ij}^k = 0$.
5) *Convexity*. If convexity is not fulfilled, then things that may
   look like wiggles may happen to have less energy than the
   geodesic. We also have to be careful with the curvature of our
   manifold. When (non-negative) curvature condition is fulfilled and
   convexity is checked, then the convergence to the geodesic can be
   taken from $t\to\infty$, and is not restricted to the sequence
   $t_n$.


One of the things I learnt from this exercise is to be careful when
using normal coordinates and integrating by parts. We will
go through the computations of $E$, $E_t$ and $E_{tt}$.

The Energy functional of a curve $\alpha$ is given by
$E(u):= \frac{1}{2}\int_{S^1} \|\dot{\alpha}(t)\|^2dt$,
equivalently in coordinates with $\alpha(s,t)$ and $\alpha_s$
to denote $\partial_s \alpha(s,t) = \dot{\alpha}(s,t)$ we write
\begin{equation}
 E(u(\cdot,t)) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{S^1} g_{ij}\alpha^i_s\alpha^j_s ds,
\end{equation}
then
\begin{equation}
\partial_t E = \frac{1}{2}\int_{S^1} \partial_t(g_{ij}) + 2g_{ij}\alpha^i_{st}\alpha^j_s ds,
\end{equation}

When we are trying to understand the geometry of a space, we usually
wonder what are the properties whithin the space. Gauss's Theorema
Egregium, for example, shows how for surfaces in the three dimensional
space the Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic invariant. On the other
hand, we have also properties that change depending on how one
represents the geometric objects.


Let $(M^{n+1},g)$ be a Riemannian manifold and $\Sigma^n\subset M^{n+1}$
any immersed submanifold of codimension $1$ with the induced metric. $\Sigma$
will be called hypersurface if $M$.

Then the tangen bundle $TM$ can be decomposed in the following sum
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sum_TBundle}
  TM = \left(T\Sigma\right)^{\top} \oplus \left(T\Sigma\right)^{\bot}.
\end{equation}

Let $D$ the Levi-Civita connection for the ambient manifold $M$,
then it is a exercise to prove that, for any $X,Y\in T\Sigma$ 
the projection $\left(D_{X}Y\right)^{\top}$ is the Levi-Civita connection
of on $\Sigma$, denoted by $\nabla$.

Let $\xi$ a normal vector to $\Sigma$. The *second fundamental form* $h$ is
 the normal projection of $D$ for every $X,Y\in T\Sigma$
 \begin{equation}
   h(X,Y) = g(D_XY,\xi).
 \end{equation}

The *Gauss formula* for $X,Y\in T\Sigma$ reads
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Gauss_Formula}
  D_{X}Y = \nabla_{X}Y + h(X,Y)\xi.
\end{equation}

 Note that from
$g(Y,\xi)=0$ and the compatibility with the metric we have
\begin{equation}
  g(D_{X}Y,\xi) = g(Y, -D_{X}\xi).
\end{equation}

For a normal vector $\xi$ we define the *shape operator*
$A_{\xi}:T\Sigma\to T\Sigma$ as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Shape_Operator}
  A_{\xi}(X) = \left(-D_{X}\xi\right)^{\top}.
\end{equation}

Let $\{E_1,...,E_n,\xi\}$ be a basis for $TM$ such
that $\{E_i\}$ span $T\Sigma$ and $\xi$ is unit normal to $\Sigma$.
Then the shape operator in basis elements can be written as
\begin{equation}
  A_{\xi}(E_j) = A_j^i E_i,\qquad i,j=1,2,...,n.
\end{equation}

Since there is only one normal direction 
the second fundamental $h(X,Y)=g(h(X,Y),\xi)\xi$ can be identify with a real 
number $g(h(X,Y),\xi)$, and from the definition of the shape operator
we can write in coordinates
\begin{equation}
  h_{kj} =g(h(E_k,E_j),\xi) = g(E_k,A_{\xi}(E_j)) = g(E_k,A_j^iE_i) = g_{ki}A^i_j,
\end{equation}

equivalently

\begin{equation}
  A^i_j = g^{ik}h_{kj}.
\end{equation}

The *principal curvatures* of the hypersurface $\Sigma$ are the
eigenvalues of the matrix $(A^i_j)$.

** Example: Hypersurfaces as graphs in Euclidean space.
Consider that $\Sigma\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is parametrised as the
graph of a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$. Then at any point $p\in\Sigma$
there is a neighbourhood $U\in\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every $y\in\Sigma\cap f(U)$ can
be written as $y = (x,f(x))$ for some $x=(x^1,...,x^n)\in U$.

In this coordinates, the basis for the tangent space $T_p\Sigma$ is given by
\begin{equation}
y_i = \frac{\partial y}{\partial x^i} = (e_i,f_i),
\end{equation}

where $\{e_i\}$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $Df = (f_1,...,f_n)$ the
usual gradient vector of $f$. Then a unit normal vector field in $\Sigma$ is given
by
\begin{equation}
  \hat{n} = \frac{(-D f,1)}{\sqrt{1+|D f|^2}}.
\end{equation}

To compute the second fundamental form $h_{ij}=g(D_jy_i,n)$ we observe that
\begin{equation}
  D_jy_i = \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^j\partial x^i} = (0,f_{ij}),
\end{equation}
then its  normal projection is
\begin{equation}
  h_{ij} = \langle D_j y_i,\hat{n}\rangle = \frac{ f_{ij}}{\sqrt{1 + |D f|^2}}.
\end{equation}

Since we are using the standar metric of the Euclidean space, then the induce metric
on $\Sigma$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  g_{ij} = \langle y_i , y_j \rangle = \delta_{ij} + f_if_j
\end{equation}

The inverse of the metric is then

\begin{equation}
  g^{ij} = \delta_{ij} - \frac{f_if_j}{1+|D f|^2},
\end{equation}
then the shape operator is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Shape_Of_Graph}
  A^i_j = g^{ik}h_{kj} = \sum_k{\left(\delta_{ik} - \frac{f_if_k}{1+|D f|^2}\right)
\left(\frac{f_{kj}}{\sqrt{1 + |D f|^2}}\right)}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial x^j}\left(\frac{ f_i}{\sqrt{1+|D f|^2}}\right).
\end{equation}
