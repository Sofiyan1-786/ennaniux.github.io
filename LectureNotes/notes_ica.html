<h2 id="orgd7c1fbe"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Sequences and limits</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<div class="mydef">
<p>
A sequence in \(\mathbb{C}\) is a function \(\varphi: \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{C}\). We use the notation
\(z_n = \varphi(n)\) and \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) for the image \(\varphi(\mathbb{N})\).
</p>

</div>


<div class="mydef">
<p>
Let \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence in \(\mathbb{C}\). We say that the sequence converges to \(z_0\in \mathbb{C}\)
if for every \(\epsilon >0\) there exists \(n_0\in \mathbb{N}\), such that for every \(n\geq n_0\) it holds that \(|z_n - z_0| < \epsilon\). In this case
\(z_0\) is called the limit of the sequence \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) and we write
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty} z_n = z_0. \]
</p>

</div>

<div class="prop">
<p>
If a sequence converges to a limit, this is unique.
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Supose that the sequence \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\subset \mathbb{C}\) has two limits \(z_0\) and \(w_0\). Then for any \(\epsilon >0\) choose \(n\in \mathbb{C}\) such that for any \(n\geq n_0\), 
we have simultaneously \[ |z_n  - z_0| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}, \mbox{ and } |z_n - w_0 | < \frac{\epsilon}{2}. \] 
Then
\[ | z_0 - w_0 | = |z_0 - z_n + z_n - w_0 | \leq | z_n - z_0 | + | z_n - w_0| < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon. \]
Since \(\epsilon >0\) is arbitrary, this happens only if |z<sub>0</sub> - w<sub>0</sub>|  = 0. Then \(z_0 = w_0\).
</p>

</div>


<div class="prop">
<p>
Let \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence in \(\mathbb{C}\), with \(z_n = x_n + i y_n\), and \(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\). Then 
the sequence converges to \(z_0\) if and only if the sequences of real numbers \(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) and \(\{y_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) converge respectively to \(x_0\) and \(y_0\). Equivalently
\[ \lim_{n\to\infty}z_n = z_0 \iff \lim_{n\to\infty}x_n = x_0 \mbox{ and } \lim_{n\to\infty}y_n = y_0. \]
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Let \(\epsilon >0\). Then there exists \(n_0 \in \mathbb{N}\), such that for any \(n\geq n_0\) the following holds:
\[ |x_n - x_0 | = | \mbox{Re}(z_n - z_0) | \leq |z_n - z_0 | < \epsilon. \]
This shows that \(\lim_{n\to \infty} x_n = x_0\). The second part follows from a similar argument on the imaginary part of the sequence.
</p>

</div>

<div class="prop">
<p>
Every convergent sequence \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset \mathbb{C}\) is bounded, i.e., there exists
a positive real number \(M>0\), such that \(|z_n| \leq M\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\).
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Let \(\epsilon = 1\). By convergence, there exists \(n_0\in \mathbb{N}\) such that whenever \(k\geq n_0\) it holds that 
\[ |z_k - z_0 | < 1. \]
Now consider \(M = \max\{ |z_1| + 1, |z_2| + 1, \ldots, |z_{k-1}| + 1, |z_0| + 1\}\). Then it is clear that \[ |z_n| \leq M, \mbox{ for all } n \in \mathbb{N}. \]
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Remark</b> The converse of last proposition is false. Discuss an example.
</p>

<div class="thm">
<p>
(Bolzano-Weierstrass) Every bounded sequence in \(\mathbb{C}\) has a convergent sub-sequence.
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
The proof relies on the same result known for sequences of Real numbers.
</p>

<p>
Let \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) a bounded sequence where \(z_n = x_n + iy_n\). Since the sequence is bounded we note  that 
\[ |x_n | \leq |z_n| \leq M, \quad n\in\mathbb{N}. \]
Then the sequence of real numbers \(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is bounded. There exists a convergent subsequence \(\left\{x_{n_k}\right\}_{k=1}^{\infty}\) with limit \(x_0\in \mathbb{R}\).
Now consider the corresponding subsequence of complex numbers \(\left\{z_{n_k}\right\}_{k=1}^{\infty}\), where \(z_{n_k} = x_{n_k} + i y_{n_k}\). Since the sequence of complex numbers is bounded,
we conclude that \(\left\{y_{n_k}\right\}_{k=1}^{\infty}\) is also a bounded sequence of Real numbers. Then there exists a convergent subsequence \(\left\{y_{n_{k_j}}\right\}_{j=1}^{\infty}\) wiht limit \(y_0\).
Recall that any subsequence of a convergent sequence is also convergent to the same limit, and conclude that \(\left\{x_{n_{k_j}}\right\}_{j=1}^{\infty}\) has limit \(x_0\). Then 
\[ \lim_{j\to \infty} z_{n_{k_j}} = \lim_{j\to \infty} \left(x_{n_{k_j}} + i y_{n_{k_j}}\right)  = x_0 + iy \]
is a convergent subsequence of  \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\).
</p>

</div>

<div class="mydef">
<p>
A sequence \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is called Cauchy sequence if for every \(\epsilon >0\)
there exists \(n_0\in\mathbb{N}\) such that, if \(n,m \geq n_0\) then \(|z_n - z_m| <\epsilon\).
</p>

</div>


<div class="thm">
<p>
A sequence \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) converges if and only if \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is a Cauchy sequence.
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
By writing \(z_n = x_n + i y_n\) and from the inequalities
\[ |x_n - x_m | \leq |z_n - z_m|, \]
and
\[ |y_n - y_m | \leq |z_n - z_m|, \]
it follows that The sequence  \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) of complex numbers is Cauchy if and only if  \(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) and \(\{y_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) are Cauchy sequences of Real numbers if and only if  the sequences of real numbers \(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) and \(\{y_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) are convergent if and only if \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is a convergent sequence.
</p>

</div>


<div class="prop">
<p>
Let \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) and \(\{w_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) two convergent sequences, with \(\lim_{n\to\infty}z_n = z_0\) and \(\lim_{n\to\infty}w_n = w_0\). Then the following identities hold:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}(z_n + w_n) = z_0 + w_0\),</li>
<li>\(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}(z_n \, w_n) = z_0 \, w_0\),</li>
<li>\(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}|z_n| = |z_0|\),</li>
<li>If \(w_n \neq 0\) for all \(n\in \mathbb{N}\), then \(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\dfrac{z_n}{w_n}\right) = \dfrac{z_0}{w_0}\).</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Proof of 1. It follows from the triangle inequality and the definition. Let \(\epsilon > 0\), then there exists \(n_0 \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for any \(n\geq n_0\) it simultaneously holds \(|z_n - z_0| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}\) and \(|w_n - w_0| < \frac{\epsilon}{2}\), then 
\[ |(z_n + w_n) - (z_0 + w_0) | = |(z_n - z_0) + (w_n - w_0) | < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon. \]
That is \(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}(z_n + w_n) = z_0 + w_0\).
</p>

<p>
Proof of 2. It follows also from the definition, the triangle inequality and the fact that every convergent sequence is bounded. Since \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\) is convergent, there is \(M_1>0\) such that \(|z_n| < M_1\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) and the same for \(\{w_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\), there is \(M_2 >0\) such that \(|w_n| < M_1\) for all \(n\in\mathbb{N}\). Take \(M = \max\{M_1,M_2\}\), and then \(M>0\) is a bound for both sequences.  Let \(\epsilon > 0\), then there exists \(n_0 \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for any \(n\geq n_0\) it simultaneously holds \(|z_n - z_0| < \frac{\epsilon}{2M}\) and \(|w_n - w_0| <  \frac{\epsilon}{2M}\). Then 
</p>
\begin{equation*} \begin{split} |z_n w_n - z_0 w_0 | &= | z_n w_n - z_n w_0 + z_n w_0 - z_0 w_0 | \\ & \leq | z_n w_n - z_n w_0 | + |z_n w_0 - z_0 w_0 | \\ &  = |z_n| | w_n - w_0| + |w_0| |z_n - z_0|  \\ & \leq M | w_n - w_0| + M |z_n - z_0| \\ & < \frac{\epsilon}{2} +  \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon. \end{split} \end{equation*}
<p>
That is \(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}(z_n \, w_n) = z_0 \, w_0\).
</p>

<p>
Proof of 3. It follows from a version of the triangle inequality. Let \(\epsilon > 0\), then there exists \(n_0 \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for any \(n\geq n_0\) it holds \(|z_n - z_0| < \epsilon\). Note then that
\[ |\, |z_n| - |z_0| \, | \leq |z_n - z_0| < \epsilon. \]
That is \(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}|z_n| = |z_0|\).
</p>

<p>
Proof of 4. Let \(\epsilon_1 = \frac{|w_0|}{2}\), then there exists \(n_0 \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for any \(n\geq n_0\) it holds \(|w_n - w_0| < \frac{|w_0|}{2}\). First note that
\[ \left| \frac{1}{w_n} - \frac{1}{w_0} \right| = |\frac{ w_0 - w_n}{w_n w_0} | = \frac{ |w_0 - w_n|}{|w_n |\, |w_0|}. \]
</p>

<p>
On the other hand by the triangle inequality
\[ |w_0| - |w_n| \leq \left|\, |w_0| - |w_n|\, \right| \leq |w_0 - w_n | < \frac{|w_0|}{2}, \]
this implies
\[ \frac{|w_0|}{2} \leq |w_n|, \]
or equivalently
\[ \frac{1}{|w_n|} \leq \frac{2}{|w_0|}. \]
Then we get
\[ \left| \frac{1}{w_n} - \frac{1}{w_0} \right| \leq \frac{ |w_0 - w_n|}{|w_n |\, |w_0|} \leq \frac{2 |w_0 - w_n|}{ |w_0|^2}. \]
</p>

<p>
For any \(\epsilon >0\) define \(\epsilon_2 = \frac{|w_0|^2\epsilon}{2}\), then there exists \(m_0 \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for any \(n\geq m_0\) it holds \(|w_n - w_0| < \frac{|w_0|^2\epsilon}{2}\).
Take \(N_0 = \max\{n_0, m_0\}\). Then we can improve our last inequality, for any \(n \geq N_0\) it holds
\[ \left| \frac{1}{w_n} - \frac{1}{w_0} \right| \leq \frac{ |w_0 - w_n|}{|w_n |\, |w_0|} \leq \frac{2 |w_0 - w_n|}{ |w_0|^2} < \epsilon. \]
This shows that  \(\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{w_n} = \frac{1}{w_0}\).
Finally applying (2) of this proposition we have
\[ \displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{z_0}{w_n} = \lim_{n\to\infty} z_n\frac{1}{w_n} = \lim_{n\to\infty} z_n \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{w_n} = \frac{z_0}{w_0} \]

If \(K\) is compact then \(K\) is closed. Supose there is \(z_0\in \mbox{cl}(K)\) such that \(z_0\notin K\), and consider the following sets: All balls \(B_r(z_0)\) and for each \(z\in K\) choose a ball \(U_z:=B_{r_z}(z)\) such that \(r_z>0\) is small enough to not intersect one of the \(B_r(z_0)\).

(1 \(\Rightarrow\) 2) Assume \(f\) is continuous in \(A\). Let \(V\subset \mathbb{C}\) any open such that \(f(A)\cap V \neq \emptyset\). We want to show that \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open subset of \(A\). Let \(z_0\in f^{-1}(V)\), then \(f(z_0)\in V\), and since \(V\) is open there exists an open ball \(B_r(f(z_0)) \subset V\). Since \(f\) is assume to be continuous, if we let \(\epsilon = r\), then there exists \(\delta >0\) such that for any \(z\in A\) such that \(|z - z_0| <\delta\) we have \(|f(z) - f(z_0)| < \epsilon\).

More over, since \(z_0 \in U\) there exists \(\delta>0\) such that \(B_{\delta}(z_0)\) is contained in \(U\) and also \(f(B_{\delta}(z_0)\cap A) \subset B_{\epsilon}(f(z_0))\).

Let \(\{V_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}\) be an open cover of \(f(K)\), i.e., \(f(K) \subseteq \cup_{\alpha \in I}V_{\alpha}\).

Since \(f\) is continuous then \(f^{-1}(V_{\alpha})\) is open for every \(\alpha \in I\). This means that \(\{f^{-1}(V_{\alpha})\}_{\alpha\in I}\) is an open cover of the compact set \(K\). Then there exists a finite upen subcover \(\{f^{-1}(V_{\alpha_i})\}_{i=1}^{k}\) such that \(K\subset \cup_{i=1}^{k} f^{-1}(V_{\alpha_i})\). Now by properties of the direct image \(f(K) \subset f^{-1}\left(\cup_{i=1}^{k} f^{-1}(V_{\alpha_i}) \right) = \cup_{i=1}^{k} f\left(f^{-1}(V_{\alpha_i})\right) \subseteq \cup_{i=1}^{k} V_{\alpha_i}\).

Let \(K\subset \mathbb{C}\) be a compact set, \(f:K\to\mathbb{C}\) continuous. Then \(f\) is uniformly continuous.

<div class="proof">
<p>
For this proof, we use the characterisation of compact sets by sequences, and by contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Suppose then that \(f\) is continuous on the compact set \(K\) but \(f\) not uniformly continuous. Then there exists \(\epsilon >0\) such that for every \(\delta >0\) 
there exist \(z_0,w_0\in K\) such that on one side \(|z_0 - w_0 | < \delta\) and on the other \(|f(z_0) - f(w_0)| > \epsilon\).
Since this holds for any \(\delta >0\), take \(\delta_n = \frac{1}{n}\). The for each \(n\in \mathbb{N}\) there are \(z_n, w_n\in K\) such that
\(|z_n - w_n | < \frac{1}{n}\) and \(|f(z_n) - f(w_n)| >0 \epsilon\).
</p>

<p>
Now consider the sequence \(\{z_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\subseteq K\) just constructed. By compactness we know that there exists a convergent subsequence, namely
\(\{z_{n_j}\}_{j=1}^{\infty}\), such that \(\lim_{j\to \infty} z_{n_j} = a_0\).
</p>

<p>
The inequality \(| z_{n_j} - w_{n_j} | < \frac{1}{n_j}\) implies that the subsequence \(\{w_{n_j}\}_{j=1}^{\infty}\) converges also to the same limit, \(\lim_{j\to \infty} w_{n_j} = a_0\).
</p>

<p>
By the continuity of \(f\) it holds
\[ \lim_{j\to \infty} f(z_{n_j}) = f(w_{n_j}) = f(a_0). \]
</p>

<p>
Then, there exits \(j_0>0\) such that for any \(j > j_0\) it holds simultaneously 
\[ | f(z_{n_j}) - f(a_0) | < \frac{ \epsilon}{2}, \quad \mbox{and}\quad | f(w_{n_j}) - f(a_0) | < \frac{ \epsilon}{2}. \]
</p>

<p>
The then we have the following sequence of inequalities
\[ \epsilon < |f(z_{n_j}) - f(w_{n_j})| \leq | f(z_{n_j}) - f(a_0) | +  | f(w_{n_j}) - f(a_0) | < \frac{ \epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon, \]
which its a contradiction itself. Consequently \(f\) is uniformly continuous in \(K\).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The definition of the derivative of a complex function is very familiar from the one we know for the real valued functions. But also we should explore in this section how this definition
relates with that of the derivative of maps from \(\mathbb{R}^2\) to \(\mathbb{R}^2\). The properties of complex differentiation have been extensively used and applied in other areas of mathematics, leading to astonishing consequences and results.
</p>

<p>
We will give the concept of derivative for functions defined on open subsets of the complex plane, although it can be generalised to subsets which are not necessarily open by writing the definitions using the induced topology. In order to keep the exposition and notation simple, we will be dealing only with functions defined on  open subsets of the complex plane.
Recall that a <b>domain</b> \(\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{C}\) is an open connected set.
</p>

<div class="mydef">
<p>
Let \(\Omega\subset \mathbb{C}\) be an open set, and  \(f:\Omega \to \mathbb{C}\). We say that \(f\) is (complex) differentiable at \(z_0\in \Omega\) if the following limit exists
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{f(z)- f(z_0)}{z - z_0}. \]
The limit is called the derivative of \(f\) at \(z_0\) and will be denoted by \(f'(z_0)\), or \(\frac{df}{dz}(z_0)\).<br />
If \(f\) is differentiable at every point of a domain \(\Omega\), then we call \(f\) <b>holomorphic</b> in \(\Omega\).<br />
We use the term <b>analytic</b> with the same meaning as holomorphic.
If \(f\) is holomorphic on the whole complex plane \(\mathbb{C}\), then we call \(f\) <b>entire</b>.
</p>

</div>


<p>
Examples of holomorphic functions are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(f(z) = c\), (the constant function). With \(f'(z) = 0\), for all \(z\in \mathbb{C}\).</li>
<li>\(f(z) = z\), (the identity function). With \(f'(z) = 1\), for all \(z\in \mathbb{C}\).</li>
<li>\(f(z) = z^n\). With \(f'(z) = nz^{n-1}\), for all \(z\in \mathbb{C}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The function \(f(z) = \bar{z}\) is not complex differentiable anywhere in \(\mathbb{C}\). Take \(z_0\in \mathbb{C}\) and consider the following two sequences converging to the same complex number \(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\), \(w_n = x_n + iy_0\) and \(\xi_n = x_0 + i y_n\). Notice now that
\[ \lim_{w_n\to z_0} \frac{f(w_n) - f(z_0)}{w_n - z_0} = \frac{\bar{w_n} - \bar{z_0}}{(x_n + iy_0) - (x_0 + iy_0)} = \frac{x_n - iy_0 - (x_0 - iy_0)}{x_n - x_0} = \frac{x_n - w_0}{x_n - x_0} = 1, \]
and a similar computation gives
\[ \lim_{\xi_n\to z_0} \frac{f(\xi_n) - f(z_0)}{\xi_n - z_0} = \frac{x_n - iy_0 - (x_0 - iy_0)}{i(y_n - y_0)} = \frac{- i(y_n - y_0)}{i(y_n - y_0)} = -1, \]

<p>
If \(f:\Omega \to \mathbb{C}\) is complex differentiable at \(z_0\) then it is continuous at \(z_0\)
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Note that since \(f'(z_0) = \lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{f(z)- f(z_0)}{z - z_0}\) exists and \(\lim_{z\to z_0} z - z_0 = 0\), then the limit of o the product exists and it is the product of the limits
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0}f(z)- f(z_0) = \lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{f(z)- f(z_0)}{z - z_0} \cdot (z - z_0) = f'(z_0) \lim_{z\to z_0} (z - z_0) = f'(z_0) \cdot 0 = 0, \]
equivalently
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0}f(z) = f(z_0),\]
then, \(f\) is continuous at \(z_0\).

Let \(U,V \subseteq \mathbb{C}\) be two open sets and consider the functions  \(f:U\to \mathbb{C}\), \(g:V \to \mathbb{C}\) where \(f(U)\subseteq V\). If \(f\) is complex differentiable at \(z_0\in U\), and
\(g\) complex differentiable at \(f(z_0)\in V\), then the composition \(g\circ f : U \to \mathbb{C}\), given by \((g\circ f)(z) = g(f(z))\), is complex differentiable at \(z_0\in U\), and
\[ (g\circ f)'(z_0) = g'(f(z_0))\, f'(z_0). \]
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Case 1. Suppose \(f'(z_0) \neq 0\). Then \(f(z) - f(z_0) \neq 0\) holds for a small neighbourhood around \(z_0\). We can write
\[ \frac{g(f(z)) - g(f(z_0))}{z - z_0} = \frac{g(f(z)) - g(f(z_0))}{f(z) - f(z_0)} \frac{f(z)) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0}.\]
Since \(f\) is complex differentiable at \(z_0\),  then it is continuous and it holds
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0} f(z) = f(z_0). \]
Then, by taking the limit we obtain
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{g(f(z)) - g(f(z_0))}{f(z) - f(z_0)}  \lim_{z\to z_0}\frac{f(z)) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0} = g'(f(z_0)) \, f(z_0). \]
</p>

<p>
Case 2. Suppose now that \(f'(z_0) = 0\). Then one can show that \(g'(f(z_0)) = 0\) and then would finish the proof. Note that since \(g'(f(z_0))\) exists, then there is a neighbourhood around
\(f(z_0)\) such that the quotient
\[ \frac{g(f(z)) - g(f(z_0))}{f(z) - f(z_0)} ,\]
is bounded, i.e. , there is a positive number \(M>0\), and \(\delta >0\) such that for every \(0 < | f(z) - f(z_0) |< \delta\) we have
\[ \left| \frac{g(f(z)) - g(f(z_0))}{f(z) - f(z_0)}\right| < M .\]
Equivalently
\[  |g(f(z)) - g(f(z_0))| < M | {f(z) - f(z_0)} | .\]
Then
\[ \left| \frac{g(f(z)) - g(f(z_0))}{z - z_0}\right| < M \left| \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z - z_0} \right|.\]
</p>

<p>
This shows that \((g\circ f)'(z_0) = 0 = g'(f(z_0)) f'(z_0) = g'(f(z_0)) \cdot 0\).

<p>
Now, since \(f:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}\) can also be viewed as a map \(f: \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\), lets explore the relationship between the two definitions of derivatives.
First recall
</p>
<div class="mydef">
<p>
A map \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\) is differentiable at \(a\in \mathbb{R}^n\) if there is a linear transformation \(Df_a: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\) such that
\[ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{|f(a + h) - f(a) - Df_a(h)|}{|h|} = 0. \]
</p>

</div>

<p>
In order to represent this linear transformation as a matrix, we introduce partial derivatives for a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) at \(a \in \mathbb{R}^n\) as the limit
\[ \frac{\partial f(a)}{\partial x_i} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_i + h, \ldots, a_n) - f(a_1,\ldots, a_n)}{h}.\]
</p>


<div class="thm">
<p>
If \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\) is differentiable at a point \(a\in \mathbb{R}^n\), then all the first order partial differential exist, and the matrix representing the linear transformation \(Df_a\) is 
\[ (Df_a) = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{\partial f_1(a)}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1(a)}{\partial x_n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots  \\
\frac{\partial f_m(a)}{\partial x_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m(a)}{\partial x_n}\\
\end{array} \right). \]
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Remark</b> Note that \((Df_a)\)  is a matrix with \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns.
</p>

<p>
The converse is not true unless we add a stronger hypothesis 
</p>

<div class="thm">
<p>
Let \(f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m\), with \(f= (f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_m)\). The derivative  \(Df_a\) exists if all first order partial derivatives \(\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\), \(1\leq j \leq n\), and \(1\leq i \leq m\), exist in an open set containing \(a\), and each of these partial derivatives are continuous at \(a\).

partial derivatives at \((0,0)\) exist, but it is not differentiable at \((0,0)\).

<b>Remark</b>. If \(f:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}\) is complex differentiable at \(z_0\), then its derivative is a complex number, \(f'(z_0) = a_1 + i a_2\) for some \(a_1,a_2\in \mathbb{R}\).
The corresponding linear transformation representing \(f'(z_0)\) by complex multiplication is \(T:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\)  acting on to the basic elements \((1,0),(0,1)\) as
\(T(1,0) = (a_1 , a_2)\), and \(T(0,1) = (-a_2 , a_1)\). Then the matrix representation of \(T\) is

Let \(\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{C}\) an open set \(f:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}\), and \(z_0= x_0 + iy_0 \in \Omega\). Write \(f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)\), where \(u,v:\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\).
The function \(f\) is complex differentiable at \(z_0\) \(\Leftrightarrow\) \(u,v\) are real differentiable at \((x_0,y_0)\) and the following identities hold

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} (x_0,y_0) & = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} (x_0,y_0), \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} (x_0,y_0) & =- \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} (x_0,y_0).
\end{split}
\end{equation}

</div>

<div class="proof">
<p>
(\(\Rightarrow\)) 
</p>

<p>
Suppose \(f\) is complex differentiable at \(z_0\). Then by definition
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0} \left[\frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{ z- z_0} - f'(z_0)\right] = 0 ,\]
Then taking module we also have 
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0} \left|\frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{ z- z_0} - f'(z_0)\right| = \lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{ \left|f(z) - f(z_0)  - f'(z)(z-z_0)\right|}{ \left|z-z_0\right|} =  0.\]
</p>

<p>
Now writing the last expression as mapping between \(\mathbb{R}^2\), i.e, \(z= x + i y = (x, y)\), \(z_0= x_0 + i y_0 = (x_0, y_0)\), and using the matrix representation of \(f'(z_0) = a_1 + i a_2\), we can rewrite the last equaiton as follows
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{\left| f(x,y) - f(x_0,y_0)  - \left(
 \begin{array}{cc}
a_{1} & -a_{2}\\
a_{2} &  a_{1}\\
\end{array} \right) 
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
x - x_0\\
y - y_0\\
\end{array} \right)
\right|}{\left| (x-x_0, y-y_0) \right|} = 
\lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0,y_0)} \frac{\left| f(x,y) - f(x_0,y_0)  - T(x - x_0, y - y_0)\right|}{\left| (x - x_0, y - y_0)\right|} = 0, \]
which is clearly equivalent to 
\[ \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\left| f(x_0 + h_1, y_0 + h_2) - f(x_0,y_0)  - T(h)\right|}{\left| h \right|} = 0, \]
hence \(f:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2\) is real differentiable.
</p>

<p>
Then we know that if \(f(x,y) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)\) is real differentiable at \(z_0 = (x_0,y_0)\). Then the partial derivatives of \(u\) and \(v\) exist and moreover 
we showed that \(Df_{z_0} = T\). Looking at the matrix representation we have
\[ 
Df_{z_0} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}  &  \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}  &  \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\
\end{array} \right)
=
\left( \begin{array}{cc}
a_1 &  -a_2 \\
a_2 &  a_1 \\
\end{array} \right) = T \]
which implies the Cauchy-Riemann equations:
\[  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0) = a_1 = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0), \quad \mbox{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0) = - a_2 = - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0) .\]

<p>
(\(\Leftarrow\))
</p>

<p>
Let \(u,v:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\), real differentiable functions at \(z_0 = (x_0, y_0)\), satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Define \(a_1, a_2\) by
\[  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0) = a_1 = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0), \quad \mbox{and} \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0) = - a_2 = - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0),\]
and define the following linear transformation (in matrix representation)
\[ 
T = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
a_1 &  -a_2 \\
a_2 &  a_1 \\
\end{array} \right). \]
Now, define the complex number \(A = a_1 + i a_2\). It holds
</p>

<p>
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{| f(z) - f(z_0) - A (z-z_0) |}{|z- z_0|} = \lim_{(x,y)\to (x_0, y_0)} \frac{| f(x,y) - f(x_0,y_0) - T ( x-x_0, y-y_0) |}{|(x,y) - (x_0, y_0)|} = 0. \]
</p>

<p>
We can conclude that
\[ \lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z- z_0} = A, \]
\(f\) is complex diffetentiable at \(z_0\).

If \(u,v:\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\) have <b>continuous first-order partial derivatives</b> at \((x_0,y_0)\) that satisfy the <b>Cauchy-Riemann equations</b>, then \(f(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x, y)\) is <b>complex differentiable</b> at \(z_0 = x_0 + i y_0\).

<p>
<b>Remark</b>. A usual notation is for the Cauchy-Riemann equations is \(u_x = v_y\) and \(u_y = -v_x\).<br />
Holomorphy is the property of a complex function of being differentiable at every point of a domain. Consequently, we can say that a complex function \(f\), whose real and imaginary parts \(u\) and \(v\) are real-differentiable functions, is holomorphic if and only if, the Cauchy-Riemann equaitons are satisfied at every point of the domain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example</b>. The following example will clarify the hypothesis of the previous theorem, that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not sufficient to establish the complex differentiability of a function.
Let \(f:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}\) be defined as
\[ f(z) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
\frac{z^5}{|z|^4}, & \mbox{for} & z\neq 0, \\
0, & \mbox{for} & z= 0. \\
\end{array} \right. \]
The function \(f\) is not complex differentiable at \(z=0\). Let \(z = x\), with \(x \to 0\). Then
\[ \lim_{z\to 0} \frac{f(z)  - f(0)}{z - z_0} = \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\frac{x^5}{|x|^4}}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0}\frac{x^4}{|x|^4}{x} = 1 .\]
Now take \(z = i\,y\), with \(y\to 0\) and observe
\[ \lim_{z\to 0} \frac{f(z)  - f(0)}{z - z_0} = \lim_{y\to 0} \frac{\frac{(iy)^5}{|y|^4}}{y} = \lim_{y\to 0}\frac{-y^5}{|y|^4} = -1 .\]
Then we conclude that 
\[ \lim_{z \to 0} \frac{f(z) - f(0)}{z-0} ,\]
does not exists.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand 
\[ u(x,0) = x, \quad u(0,y) = v(x,0) = 0, \quad v(0,y) = y, \]
Then we have at \((0,0)\):
\[ u_x = v_y = 1,\quad u_y = -v_x = 0.\]
</p>

<p>
What is happening here?
</p>


<p>
\[f(z) = \frac{ x^5  - 10 x^3 y^2 + 5 x y^4}{(x^2 + y^2) ^2} + i \frac{5 x^4 y -  10 x^2 y^3  +  y^5}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} \]

Note that if \(f(z)  = u(x,y) + i v(x, y)\) is a complex differentiable function at \(z_0\), when taking the limit of the quitient of differences, it does not matter how \(z \to z_0\) approaches,
then 
\[ f'(z_0) = \lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z-z_0} = \lim_{x\to x_0} \frac{f(x + iy_0) - f(z_0)}{x - x_0} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \]
and similarily:
\[ f'(z_0) = \lim_{z\to z_0} \frac{f(z) - f(z_0)}{z-z_0} = \lim_{y\to y_0} \frac{f(x_0 + iy) - f(z_0)}{i(y - y_0)} = -i \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}. \]

If \(f = u + iv\) is holomorphic, and the functions \(u\) and \(v\) have continuous second-order partial derivatives, then \(u\) and \(v\) are harmonic.
</p>

<div class="proof">
<p>
Since the second-order partial derivatives are continuous, one can interchange the order of differentiation for \(u\) and \(v\). It follows then from the Cauchy-Riemann equations that
\[ u_{xx} = v_{yx} = v_{xy} = -u_{yy} \Longrightarrow u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0.\]
Then, \(u\) is harmonic. The proof for \(v\) is similar.

If \(u\) is harmonic on a domain D, and \(v\) is a harmonic function such that
\(u + iv\) is analytic, we say that v is a harmonic conjugate of \(u\). The
harmonic conjugate \(v\) is unique, up to adding a constant.

Let \(\Omega\) be an open disk, or an open rectangle with sides parallel

<b>Example</b>. Show that \(u(x,y) = xy\) is harmonic and find an harmonic conjugate.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to show that \(u\) is harmonic. To find the harmonic conjugate function \(v\) we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations
\[ u_x = y = v_y,\]
and from this we can conclude by integrating with respect to \(y\) that
\[ v = \frac{y^2}{2} + \phi(x). \]
Using again the Cauchy-Riemann equations, \(v_x = - u_y = -x\) we get
\[ v_x = \phi'(x) = -x,\]
and by integrating with respect to \(x\) we obtain
\[ \phi(x)  = -\frac{x^2 }{2} + C. \]

Then we can write
\[ v(x,y) = -\frac{x^2 }{2} + \frac{y^2 }{2} + C. \]

Before proving the following theorem we will need the following result.

Let \(\gamma_1\) and \(\gamma_2\) two curves intersecting at \(z_0\). Then the angle between the curves is the angle between the tangent vectors \(\gamma_1'(0)\) and \(\gamma_2(0)\), to compute this angle we use

<div class="proof">
<p>
For any \(z_0\in\Omega\), if \(z_0 \neq 0\) then we will consider \(g(z) = f(z - z_0)\) so \(g(z) = f(0)\). Then its enough to prove the assertion when \(z_0 = 0\).
Consider the following lines \(L_1 = \{z \in \Omega \, | \, \mbox{Im}(z) = 0, \mbox{Re}(z) \geq 0 \}\) and for some fixed \(m\in \mathbb{R}\), \(L_2 = \{ z\in \Omega \, | \, z = x + i mx, x\geq 0 \}\), where \(m=\tan \alpha\) is the angle measured from the real line and counterclockwise.
Because we are assuming \(f\) is conformal at \(z=0\) the angle at \(f(0)\) between the corresponding curves \(f(L_1)\) and \(f(L_2)\) should remain unchanged. 
</p>

<p>
Write \(f(z) = u(x,y) + v(x,y)\). If the angle \(\beta\) of the tangent vector at \(f(0)\) of the curve \(L_2\) is given by \(\beta\), and then angle the angle \(\beta\) of the tangent vector at \(f(0)\) of the curve \(L_1\) is given by \(\theta\), then another way to measure the angle \(\alpha\) is by noticing \(\beta - \theta = \alpha\), or equivalently \(\theta = \beta - \alpha\). Let \(c = \tan (\beta - \alpha) = \tan (\theta)\). Also notice
\[ \tan(\beta)=\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{v(x,mx) - v(0,0)}{u(x,mx)- u(0,0)} = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\frac{v(x,mx) - v(0,0)}{x}}{\frac{u(x,mx) - u(0,0)}{x}}= \frac{v_x(0,0) + m v_y(0,0)}{u_x(0,0)+ m u_y(0,0)}, \]
where we have use the assumption that \(f\) is real differentiable and the chain rule (or directional derivative). Also since we assume that \(Df_0\) is not the zero matrix, last limit is not zero and then we also know \(\cot(\beta)\).
</p>

<p>
Then
</p>

<p>
\[ c = \tan(\theta) = \tan(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{\tan(\beta) - \tan(\alpha)}{1 + \tan(\alpha)\tan(\beta)} = \frac{ \frac{v_x + m v_y}{u_x + m u_y} - m}{ 1 + m\, \frac{v_x + m v_y}{u_x + m u_y}} \]
</p>

<p>
Not then that this can be written as
</p>

<p>
\[ v_x + mv_y - m(u_x + m u_y)  = c( u_x + m u_y + m v_x + m^2 v_y) \]
expanding the brackets:
\[ - m^2 u_y + m(v_y - u_x) + v_x = cm^2 v_y + cm( u_y + v_x)  + cu_x, \]
</p>

<p>
These are polynomials in \(m\) , then the coefficients they must be identical
</p>
\begin{eqnarray}
-u_y = cv_y \\
v_y - u_x = c(u_y + v_x) \\
v_x = cu_x \\
\end{eqnarray}

<p>
Then by substitution we get
</p>
\begin{equation}
v_y - u_x = c(u_y + v_x) = c( - cv_y + cu_x) = -c^2 (v_y - u_x)
\end{equation}

<p>
It follows
\[ (1 + c^2) (v_y - u_x) = 0,\]
</p>

<p>
this implies \(u_x = v_y\). Then \(-u_y = c u_x = v_x\).

<p>
Since \(f\) is real differentiable at \(z=0\) and satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations then \(f\) is complex differentiable at \(z=0\).

<p>
Now suppose that that \(f\Omega\to\mathbb{C}\) is conformal, and consider \(z_0\in \Omega\). Then the angles between two rays intersecting at \(z_0\) remain unchanged, but not necessarily their lengths. Since
\[ |f'(z_0) | = \lim_{z\to z_0} = \frac{|f(z) - f(z_0)|}{|z-z_0|}, \] 
one can say that the linear change of scale at \(z_0\), caused by the transformation \(f\), is independent of the direction. "Small circles around \(z_0\) are mapped into small circles around \(f(z_0)\), at a scale \(|f'(z_0)|\).

A continuously differentiable (or \(C^1\)) curve in a domain \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}\) is a map \(\alpha : [a,b] \to \Omega\), where \([a,b]\) is an interval in the real, and 
such that 
\[ \alpha'(t) =  \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{ \alpha(t + h) - \alpha(t)}{h},\]
 exists at each point \(t\in [a, b]\) (in the one-sided
sense at the endpoints) and  such that \(\alpha'\) is continuous on \([a, b]\). 
We will also use the symbol \(\alpha\) to denote also its trace, that is the set
of points \(\{\alpha(t) \, | \,  t \in [a, b]\}\).

<p>
A curve is called <b>piecewise continuously differentiable</b> if it can be written as a finite union of continuously differentiable curves. 
</p>

<p>
The curve \(\alpha\) is called <b>closed</b> if \(\alpha (a) = \alpha (b)\).
</p>

<p>
It is called <b>simple closed</b> if it is closed and it does not intersecting itself, i.e., \(\alpha(s) = \alpha (t)\) and \(s\neq t\) is only possible when either that \(s = a\) and \(t = b\) or \(s = b\) and \(t = a\).
</p>

<p>
A simple closed curve \(\alpha\) is said to be <b>positively oriented</b> if the region interior to the curve is to the left of the curve while it is being traversed from \(t = a\) to \(t = b\). In other case the curve is called <b>negatively oriented</b>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
<b>Example</b> The curve \(\alpha_1: [0,2\pi] \to \mathbb{C}\) given by \(\alpha(t) = e^{it}\) is \(C^1\) and positively oriented, while \(\alpha_2: [0,2\pi] \to \mathbb{C}\) given by \(\alpha_2(t) = e^{-it}\) is negatively oriented.

<b>Cauchy's integral formula</b>. Let \(f:\Omega \to \mathbb{C}\) holomorphic in \(\Omega\).

Let \(z_0 \in \Omega\) and define the function

Let \(f\) be holomorphic in a domain \(\Omega\), and let \(z_0\in \Omega\) fixed. Assume that the following closed disc is contained in \(\Omega\):
\[ \bar{B}_r(z_0) = \{ z \, | \, |z-z_0| \leq r \} \subseteq \Omega. \]
Then \(f\) can be written in \(\bar{B}_r(z_0)\) as a convergent power series 
\[ f(z) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k (z - z_0)^n.\]
The convergence is absolutely and uniformly in \(B_r(z_0)\) (the interior).

<div class="proof">
<p>
Take any point in \(w\in B_r(z_0)\) and consider the curve \(\alpha(t) = z_0 + r e^{it}\), \(t\in [0,2\pi]\). Note then that \(|w-z_0| < r = |\alpha(t) - z_0|\). Then for any \(\xi\) such that \(|\xi - z_0| = r\) we have
\[ \frac{1}{\xi - w} = \frac{1}{\xi - z_0 + z_0 - w} = \frac{1}{(\xi - z_0)\left( 1 + \frac{z_0 - w }{ \xi - z_0}\right) }= \frac{1}{\xi - z_0}\frac{1}{\left( 1 - \frac{w - z_0 }{ \xi - z_0}\right) }, \]
note now that \(|w-z_0|/(\xi-z_0) < 1\), and then we can express the last term as  a power series:

<p>
\[ \frac{1}{\xi - w}  = \frac{1}{\xi-z_0}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left( \frac{w - z_0 }{ \xi - z_0}\right)^k, \]
using the fact that  the series is absolutely and uniformly convergent, and the Cauchy integral formula we have:
\[ f(w) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\alpha} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w}d\xi = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\alpha} \frac{f(\xi)d\xi}{(\xi - z_0)^{k+1}} (w - z_0)^k \]

<b>Morera's Theorem</b>. Let \(f:\Omega \to \mathbb{C}\) be continuous, \(\Omega\) a simply connected domain, and such that

</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Let \(z_0\in \Omega\). By the Cauchy theorem, the function 
\[ F(z) = \int_{z_0}^{z} f(\xi) d\xi,\]
is well defined and independent of the path connecting \(z\) with \(z_0\).
</p>

<p>
By continuity of \(f\) for any \(z \in \Omega\) and \(\epsilon >0\), there exists \(\delta >0\) such that if \(|\xi - z| < \delta\) then $|f(&xi;) - f(z) | &lt; &epsilon;. Let \(|h| < \delta\), then we have
\[ \frac{F(z + h) - F(z)}{h} = \frac{1}{h} \left\{ \int_{z_0}^{z + h} f(\xi)d\xi  - \int_{z_0}^{z} f(\xi)d\xi \right\} = \frac{1}{h}\int_{z}^{z + h} f(\xi)d\xi. \]
On the other side note that 
\[ f(z) = \frac{f(z)}{h} h = \frac{f(z)}{h} \int_{z}^{z+h} d\xi = \frac{1}{h} \int_{z}^{z+h} f(z) d\xi, \]
then we can estimate
\[ \left| \frac{F(z + h) - F(z)}{h} - f(z) \right| = \left| \frac{1}{h} \int_{z}^{z+h} (f(\xi) - f(z)) d\xi \right| \leq \frac{1}{|h|} \int_{z}^{z+h} \left|f(\xi) - f(z)\right| \left| d\xi \right| \leq \epsilon,\]
where the last inequality follows when taking the straight line segment joining \(z\) with \(z + h\) (with length |h|).
Then \(F'(z) = f(z)\). This implies \(f\) is analytic and hence holomorphic in \(\Omega\).

Let \(\alpha(t) = z_0 + re^{it}\) the circle around \(z_0\) and completely contained in \(\Omega\). Then by the Cauchy integral formula we have the following mean value property
</p>
\begin{align*}
f(z_0) &= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\alpha} \frac{ f(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\
& = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{0}^{2\pi} \frac{ f(z_0 + re^{it})}{re^{it}} ire^{it}dt \\
& = \frac{1}{2\pi } \int_{0}^{2\pi} f(z_0 + re^{it})dt.
\end{align*}

<p>
We will prove that if \(z_0\in \Omega\) has maximum modulus, then \(f\) is constant, i.e.,  suppose \(z_0 \in \Omega\) such that \(|f(z) | \leq |f(z_0)|\) for all \(z\in \Omega\). Now consider \(A = \{ z\in \Omega \, | \, f(z) = f(z_0) \}\), note that this set is nonempty since \(z_0 \in A\).
</p>

<p>
Part I) <b>Prove that the set \(A\)  is open</b>. Let \(w \in A\) and suppose \(B_R(w) \subset \Omega\). Then for any \(0 < r < R\) by the mean value property we have
\[ |f(z_0)| = |f(w)| = \left|\frac{1}{2\pi\,i}\int_{0}^{2\pi} f(w + re^{it})dt \right| \leq  \frac{1}{2\pi } \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left|f(w + re^{it})\right| dt \leq |f(z_0)| \]
Then all the inequalities can be replaced by equalities and in particular we have
\[ |f(w + re^{it})| = |f(z_0)|,\]
for all \(0 < r < R\). this means that \(B_r(w) \subset A\), and hence, \(A\) is open.
</p>

<p>
Part II) <b>Prove that \(A\) is closed</b>. Recall that by topological arguments, that if \(f:\Omega \to \mathbb{C}\) is continuous, then the inverse image of a closed set in \(\mathbb{C}\) is a closed set in \(\Omega\), and similar for real valued functions. Just note that if \(r_0 = |f(z_0)|\) then
\[ A = g^{-1}(\{r_0\}), \]
where \(g(z) = |f(z)|\), is the composition of \(f\) with the complex norm. Since both are continuous, their composition is continuous and since \(\{r_0\}\subset\mathbb{R}\) is closed then \(A\) is closed.
</p>

<p>
Part III) <b>Use connectedness</b>. \(A = \Omega\). Again by topological arguments, since \(\Omega\) is assumed to be connected, the only subsets that are both open and closed are the empty set and the whole set \(\Omega\). Since \(A \neq \emptyset\) then \(A=\Omega\).

Difficult question: Is there any analytic continuation to any other larger domain?
</p>

<p>
Take a look at this video, <b><a href="https://youtu.be/sD0NjbwqlYw">Visualizing the Riemann zeta function and analytic continuation</a></b>.
</p>


<div class="mydef">
<p>
A <b>singularity</b>  is a point \(z_0\in \mathbb{C}\) at which the function \(f\) fails to be analytic.
An <b>isolated singularity</b> is a singularity \(z_0\in \mathbb{C}\) of \(f\), for which there exists a punctured disk \(B_r(z_0)\setminus\{z_0\}\) in which \(f\) is analytic.
</p>

</div>


<div class="thm">

<b>Riemann's removable singularity theorem</b>. Let \(f\) be holomorphic on a punctured disc \(B_r(w) \setminus \{w\}\). If \(f\) is bounded in \(B_r(w)\), then \(f\) can be extended to a holomorphic function \(F\) on \(B_r(w)\).
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Consider the function
\[ G(z) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc}
(z-w)^2 f(z) & \mbox{for} & z \in B_r(w)\setminus\{w\} \\
0 & \mbox{for} & z = w. \\
\end{array} \right. \]
Clearly \(G\) is holomorphic in \(B_r(w)\setminus\{w\}\). But also at \(w\) we have
\[ \lim_{\ z \to w} \frac{ G(z) - G(w)}{z-w} = \lim_{\ z \to w} \frac{(z-w)^2 f(z)}{z-w} = \lim_{\ z \to w} (z-w)f(z) = 0, \]
We claim that the last limit is equals \(0\) because, since \(f\) is bounded in \(B_r(w)\), there is \(M>0\) such that \(f(z) \leq M\) for all \(z\in B_r(w)\). 
Then \(0 \leq |(z-w)f(z)| \leq (z-w)M\) shows our claim.
</p>

<p>
Then \(G\) is holomorphic in \(B_r(w)\). Then since \(G(w) = 0\) and \(G'(w) = 0\) we have that its power series expansion is of the form \(G(z) = a_2 (z-w)^2 + \cdots = (z-w)^2 F(z)\).
Then \(F\) is our desired function.

<b>Remark</b> On the Cauchy's Theorem for Multiple Connected sets.
</p>


<p>
Suppose that \(f(z)\) is analytic on the two circles and the region in between the two circles,
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./drawing_ring.png" alt="drawing_ring.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
If \(\alpha_0\) is the outer circle and \(\alpha_1\) is the inner circle (positively oriented) then
\[ \int_{\alpha_0 - \alpha_1}f(z) = 0,\]
or equivalently
\[ \int_{\alpha_0}f(z) = \int_{\alpha_1}f(z) .\]
</p>

<p>
One can generalise this result for domains like
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./drawing_ring3.png" alt="drawing_ring3.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
where \(\alpha_0\) is the outer boundary and \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2\) and \(\alpha_3\) the inner boundaries then
\[ \int_{\alpha_0 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \alpha_3}f(z) = 0,\]
</p>

<p>
And in the case of \(m\) -th different inner components, the identity
\[ \int_{\alpha_0}f(z)dz = \sum_{k=1}^{m} \int_{\alpha_k}f(z)dz.\]
</p>

<p>
The idea now is to deal with functions that are analytic in a ring, that may have a singularity inside the inner hole.
</p>

<div class="thm">
<p>
<b>Laurent's theorem</b>. If \(f\) is holomorphic on the ring \(0 \leq r < |z - z_0| < R\), then the function can be written as the Laurent's series
\[ f(z) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} a_n (z - z_0) ^n ,\]
with
\[ a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{|w - z_0| = \rho}\frac{f(w)}{(w - z_0)^{n+1}} dw, \qquad n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots, \quad r < \rho < R. \]
</p>

</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>
Take \(\epsilon >0\) small enough such that \(0 < \epsilon < \frac{R - r}{2}\), and consider the circles \(\alpha_0\) given by \(|z-z_0| = R - \epsilon\) and  \(\alpha_1\) given by \(|z-z_0| = r + \epsilon\).
Then for any \(w\) such that \(r + \epsilon < |w - z_0 | < R-\epsilon\), we can find a small positive number \(\delta >0\) such that \(B_\delta(w)\) is completely contained between \(\alpha_0\) and \(\alpha_1\). The function 
\[ g_w(\xi) = \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w}, \]
is holomorphic in the region between \(\alpha_0\) and \(\alpha_1\) and outside \(B_\delta(w)\). Then by the observation about the Cauchy's theorem and the non-simply connected domains
 we can apply the Cauchy's theorem
\[ 0 = \int_{\alpha_0  - \alpha_1- B_{\delta}(w)} g_w(\xi)d\xi = \int_{\alpha_0  - \alpha_1} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w} d\xi - \int_{B_{\delta}(w)} g_w(\xi)d\xi = \int_{\alpha_0  - \alpha_1} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w} d\xi - 2\pi i\,f(w) \] 
</p>

<p>
\[ f(w) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\alpha_0} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w} d\xi - \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\alpha_1} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w} d\xi .\]
</p>

<p>
For the first integral, proceed as in the proof of the power extension of holomorphic functions, then
\[ \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\alpha_0} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w} d\xi = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k (w - z_0)^k, \]
with 
\[ a_k = \frac{1}{2\pi i } \int_{\alpha_0}\frac{f(\xi)}{(\xi - z_0)^{k+1}}, \quad k = 0,1,2,\ldots \]
</p>

<p>
For the second integral we use the geometric series, since along \(\alpha_1\) we have \(|\xi - z_0| < |w - z_0|\), then
</p>

<p>
\[ - \frac{1}{\xi - w} = - \frac{1}{\xi - z_0 + z_0 - w} =   \frac{1}{(w - z_0) - ( \xi - z_0 )} = \frac{1}{w - z_0} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left( \frac{\xi - z_0}{w-z_0}\right)^k,\]
</p>

<p>
Since the series is uniformly convergent then one can integrate term by term. 
</p>

<p>
\[ - \frac{1}{2\pi i } \int_{\alpha_1}\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - w}d\xi = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (w-z_0)^{-(k+1)} \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{\alpha_1} f(\xi) (\xi - z_0)^{k} d\xi = \sum_{k = -\infty}^{-1} a_k (w - z_0)^{k}, \]
with the obvius definition of \(a_{k}\) for this case, namely
\[ a_{k} = \frac{1}{2\pi i } \int_{\alpha_1}\frac{f(\xi)}{(\xi - z_0)^{-(k-1)}}d\xi . \]
</p>

</div>

<p>
In many problems, finding the Laurent series is a matter of applying an algebraic trick. Take in to consideration that if \(|a| < 1\) we have the identities:
</p>

<p>
\[ \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} a^k = \frac{1}{1-a}, \]
and
\[ \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} (-1)^ka^k = \frac{1}{1+a}. \]
</p>

<p>
<b>Example 1</b>
</p>

<p>
Find the Laurent Series for \[ f(z) = \frac{z+1}{z^3(z^2 + 1)}, \] on the region \(0 < |z| < 1\).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Note that the function has (isolated) singularities only around \(z = 0, i, -i\). Hence it is analytic in the domain \(0 < |z| < 1\).</li>
<li>Then the series expansion around \(z = 0\) is</li>
</ol>
<p>
\[ \frac{z+1}{z^3(z^2 + 1)} = (z+1)\frac{1}{z^3} \frac{1}{1 + z^2} = (z+1)\frac{1}{z^3} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^kz^{2k} =  \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^k\left(z^{2k-3} + z^{2(k-1)}\right) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^k\left(z^{2(k-1) -1} + z^{2(k-1)}\right) \]
</p>

<p>
Re-arranging indices 
</p>

<p>
\[ f(z) = \sum_{k=-1}^{\infty}(-1)^k\left(z^{2k -1} + z^{2k}\right) \]
</p>

<p>
Or explicitly
\[f(z) =  z^{-3} + z^{-2} - z^{-1} - 1 + z^{1} + z^{2} - \cdots = \frac{1}{z^3} + \frac{1}{z^2} - \frac{1}{z} - 1 + z + z^2 - z^3 - \cdots \]
</p>


<p>
<b>Example 2</b>
</p>

<p>
Consider the function \(f(z) = (z^2 - 3z + 2)^{-1}\). Find the Laurent series in the domains:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>\(1 <|z| < 2\).</li>
<li>\(|z| > 2\)</li>
<li>\(0 < | z-1 | < 1\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
First by factorisation we have
\[ f(z) = \frac{1}{z^2 - 3z + 2} = \frac{1}{(z-2)(z-1)}, \] 
hence \(z = 1,2\) are isolated singularities.
</p>

<p>
Solution of (1). Note that for \(1 < |z| <2\) implies that \(|\frac{1}{z}| <1\) and \(|\frac{z}{2}| <1\). Then the Laurent series is
\[ f(z) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k= -\infty}^{-1} z^{k}   - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^k.\]
</p>

<p>
Solution of (2). For \(|z|> 2\) the Laurent series is
\[ f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2^{k+1}} -1 \right)z^{k}. \]
</p>

<p>
Solution of  (3). Using partial fractions we put
\[ \frac{1}{(z-2)(z-1)} = \frac{A}{z-2} + \frac{B}{z-1} =  \frac{1}{z-2} - \frac{1}{z-1} = -  \frac{1}{2 - z} - \frac{1}{z-1} = -  \frac{1}{1 - (z - 1)} - \frac{1}{z-1} ,\]
</p>

<p>
and since we want to restrict to the domain \(0 < |z - 1| < 1\) then we have
\[ f(z) = - \frac{1}{z-1} - \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (z-1)^k = - \sum_{k=-1}^{\infty} (z-1)^k \]
</p>

<div class="mydef">
<p>
If \(f\) is holomorphic on \(0<|z - z_0| < R\) has a Laurent's expansion around \(z_0\), then the coefficient \(a_{-1}\) is called <b>the residue</b> of \(f\).

<b>Residue theorem</b>. Sea \(f\) holomorphic on \(\Omega\) except in a finite number of singularities. Let \(\alpha\) be a piecewise continuously differentiable closed curve with a finite number of singularities of \(f\), \(z_1, z_2 \ldots, z_k\)

\[ \int_{\alpha}f(z) dz = 2\pi i \sum_{n=1}^k \mbox{Res}_{z_n}f(z). \]

Isolated singularities can be classified as follows
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Removable</b></li>
<li><b>Poles</b></li>
<li><b>Essential</b></li>
</ol>


<p>
Observation:
</p>

<p>
The residue is zero for removable singularities. 
</p>

<p>
If \(z_0\) is a pole of order \(k\), then
\[ (z - z_0)^kf(z) = \sum_{j=-k}^{\infty} a_j (z - z_0)^{j+k}, \]
</p>

<p>
then 
\[ \lim_{z\to z} \frac{d^{k-1}}{dz^{k-1}} \left[ (z-z_0)^kf(z) \right] = (k-1)! \, a_{-1}. \]
</p>

<p>
<b>Examples</b>
</p>

<p>
Some important series are
</p>

<p>
\[ e^z = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^k}{k!}. \]
</p>

<p>
\[ \sin(z) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k-1}\frac{z^{2k-1}}{(2k-1)!} = z - \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \ldots .\]
</p>

<p>
\[ \cos(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{k}\frac{z^{2k}}{(2k)!} = 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \ldots.\]
</p>

<p>
Notice for \(0 < |z| < \infty\) we have
</p>

<p>
\[ \frac{\cos(z)}{z^2} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^{k}\frac{z^{2k-2}}{(2k)!} =  \sum_{k=-1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}\frac{z^{2k}}{(2k+2)!}\]
</p>

<p>
And similarly for \(0 < |z|\),
\[ e^{1/z^2} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{z^{-2k}}{k!} =  \sum_{k=-\infty}^{0} \frac{z^{2k}}{(-k)!}\]
</p>

<p>
Note that 
\[ \frac{\sin(z)}{z} = 1 - \frac{z^2}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{5!} - \ldots ,\]
which shows that \(z = 0\) is a removable singularity.
</p>



<p>
Find the residue of 
\[ f(z) = z^2 \sin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right). \]
</p>

<p>
Note
</p>
\begin{align*}
f(z) & = z^2 \sin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\
& = z^2 \left( z^{-1} - \frac{z^{-3}}{3!} + \frac{z^{-5}}{5!} - \ldots \right)
& =  z - \frac{z^{-1}}{3!} + \frac{z^{-3  }}{5!} - \ldots,

</p>

<p>
\[ f(z) = \frac{e^z}{z^3 - z^2}, \]
</p>

<p>
Since \(z^3 - z^2 = z^2 (z - 1)\), then \(f\) has a pole of order 2 at \(z=0\) and a simple pole at \(z = 1\),
Then
</p>

<p>
\[ \mbox{Res}_1 f(z) = \lim_{z\to 1} (z-1)f(z) = e,\]
and 
\[ \mbox{Res}_2 f(z) = \lim_{z\to 0} \frac{d}{dz} [z^2 f(z)] = \lim_{z\to 0} \frac{e^{z}(z-1) - e^z}{(z-1)^2} = -2.\]
