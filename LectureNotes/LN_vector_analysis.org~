* Geometry by Vector methods
In this section we will learn
** Vectors in R^n
+ The definition of R^n as a vector space.
+ A geometric interpretation of addition and multiplication by scalar.
+ The canonical basis
+ The change of basis
+ The Euclidean norm
+ The Euclidean distance
** Dot and cross product
+ The Euclidean inner (dot) product.
+ The geometrical interpretation of the inner product.
+ The definition of the vector (cross) product in R^3.
+ The geometrical interpretation of v \times w and |v \times w| in R^3
+ Properties of dot and cross product.
** Lines and planes.
+ The line segment between to vectors in R^n
+ The equation of a straight line in R^n
+ The equation of k-planes in R^n.
* Maps from  R^n to R^m,  
In this section we go from the standard topology of R^n to partial derivatives.
The aim is to have a collection of tools and theorems that will help us with computations
that will be used in the following sections. As a revision we will introduce:
+ Definition of a topological space (X,\tau)
+ Open sets in R^n
+ Close sets in R^n
+ Compact sets in R^n
+ Bounded sets in R^n
+ Heine- Borel theorem
+ Functions (maps) between Euclidean spaces
+ Injectivity
+ Surjectivity
+ Composition
** Limits
+ Sequences and convergence.
** Continuity
+ Definition of Continuity.
** Derivative as a linear transformation
+ Definition of derivative
+ The Jacobian matrix
+ The chain rule
+ The Hessian matrix
** Partial derivatives and directional derivatives
+ Partial derivatives
+ Critical points
+ Inverse function Theorem
+ Extreme values of a function.
* Parameterised curves
In this section we will restrict to the study of maps $\alpha : I \to \mathbb{R}^3$ called curves.
+ Definition of a parameterised smooth curve.
+ Definition of a regular curve.
+ Arch-length
** Local properties of curves
+ Definition of a curve parameterised by arch-length
+ Curvature
+ Torsion
+ Binormal
+ Frenet–Serret frame and formulas
+ Fundamental theorem of the Local Theory of Curves
** Global properties of curves. 
+ Isoperimetric Inequality
** Applications in Mechanics.
+ Newton’s second law of motion
+ Momentum
+ Angular Momentum
+ Torque
+ Examples
* Implicit function theorem and applications.
+ Inverse function theorem
+ Implicit fucntion theorem
* Parameterised surfaces.
There are some special subsets of R^n called hypersurfaces. We review some geometric tools to understand these subsets.
** Tangent vectors
+ Definition of tangent vectors
** Vector fields
+ Geometric representation of vector fields
** Tangent planes.
+ Properties of the tangent plane as Vector space
* Multiple Integration: surface areas, volumes. 

* Gradient, Divergence and Curl. Stokes’ Theorem, the Flux of a Vector Field
* Tensors and their properties. Differential forms.
