* Welcome to Cocaine Anonymous North-East District

** What is CA?
 Cocaine Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their
 experience, strength and hope with each other so that they may solve
 their common problem and help others to recover from their
 addiction. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop
 using cocaine and all other mind-altering substances. There are no
 dues or fees for membership; we are fully self supporting through our
 own contributions. We are not allied with any sect, denomination,
 politics, organisation, or institution. We do not wish to engage in
 any controversy and we neither endorse nor oppose any causes. Our
 primary purpose is to stay free from cocaine and all other
 mind-altering substances, and to help others achieve the same
 freedom.
