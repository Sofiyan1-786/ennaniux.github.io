*   Research
    My research is on elliptic partial differential equations of fully
    nonlinear type that appear in geometric problems, for instance,
    prescribed curvature. A classical problem of this type is the
    Minkowski problem which is strongly related to the Monge-Ampère
    equation. I am also interested in the geometry of hypersurfaces in
    both Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds. This equations are
    usually represented as symmetric functions on the eigenvalues of
    the second fundamental form of the hypersurface with respect to
    the induced metric. Then we can study the properties of the
    prescription function to ensure the existence of such a
    hypersurface.
